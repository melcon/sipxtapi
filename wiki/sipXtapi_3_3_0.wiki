sipXtapi 3.3.0 is currently in development in calllib-rewrite branch. At some point, these changes will be merged into trunk and development will continue in trunk.

I estimate that at the beginning of february 2009 refactored sipXcallLib will be usable enough to be merged into trunk and tested by developers, although not yet ready for production.

=== Code changes from 3.2.0 ===
==== sipXtapi ====
 * new API for getting all supported codecs. This was not available in 3.2.0 and had to be worked around (sipxConfigGetNumAvailableAudioCodecs, sipxConfigGetAvailableAudioCodec, sipxConfigGetNumSelectedAudioCodecs, sipxConfigGetSelectedAudioCodec)
 * call/media events will not be 100% compatible with 3.2.0. Any changes will be described to make upgrade to 3.3.0 easy.
 * changes in call transfer events - transferee side (recepient of REFER request) gets DIALTONE event instead of NEWCALL, when creating new call, since that call is outbound.
 * possibility to accept/reject call transfer request (sipxCallAcceptTransfer, sipxCallRejectTransfer), no support for out of dialog REFER
 * safer sipxCallPlayBufferStart, buffer can be deleted immediately after function returns
 * selection of codecs by bandwidth in sipXtapi will not be supported. Only selection by name will be supported. User may display codecs along with bandwidth requirements, and then choose codecs by name.
 * separate functions sipxCallLimitCodecPreferences, sipxCallRenegotiateCodecPreferences
 * sip proxy per line, using sipxLineSetOutboundProxy
 * better audio focus control when connecting call with SIPX_FOCUS_CONFIG
==== sipXcallLib ====
 * conferencing without having to invoke hold/unhold on conference or call.
 * public and private conferences. Public conferences will be bound to line, and any accepted inbound calls will be added to conference.
 * big refactoring in sipXcallLib, CpCall/CpPeerCall, Connection/SipConnection, CallManager/CpCallManager will be gone.
 * support for session timer (rfc4028), 100rel (rfc3262), norefersub (rfc4488), replaces (rfc3891), from-change (rfc4916), join (rfc3911)
 * UPDATE, PRACK method support
 * early and late SDP negotiation (SDP in INVITE, or ACK), configurable
 * sending SDP in unreliable and reliable 18x responses - possibility to send early audio
 * configurable sending of reliable 18x responses, session timer and usage of UPDATE method for hold/unhold/codec renegotiation
 * redirection of RTP stream by re-INVITE/UPDATE
 * refactored handling of inbound INFO
 * special message classes for messages instead of usage of OsIntPtrMsg or CpMultiStringMessage
 * less circular dependencies, various OO design defects fixed
 * old sipXcallLib is completely rewritten, since old code prevented development of new features
====sipXsdpLib ====
 * minor refactoring of sipXtackLib and sipXsdpLib - SDP handling (SdpCodecList, SdpCodecFactory), usage of SdpCodecList in sipXmediaAdapterLib whenever possible, avoid passing of arrays
 * much easier to add new codecs. Codecs are still static, but the complexity of adding one codecs has been reduced.
==== sipXtackLib ====
 * removed support for PING method, it never became a standard (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fwmiller-ping-03)
 * SipMessage class supports parsing and setting new fields
==== sipXmediaLib ====
 * wide band audio support with 48Khz internal sampling rate. Old 8Khz narrow band is recommended for server applications due to lower CPU load.
 * support for additional speex modes (11,000 bps and 18,200 bps), almost all speex wide band (16Khz), speex ultra band modes (32Khz)
 * iLBC 20ms and 30ms modes are supported for sending and receiving - 8Khz
 * G.722 codec 64 Kbps via Span DSP library - 16Khz
 * G.722.1 codec (16, 24, 32 Kbps modes) via Intel IPP - 16Khz
 * G.726 codec (16, 24, 32, 40 Kbps modes) via Span DSP library - 8Khz
 * G.728 sending 16 Kbps, receiving 12.8 Kbps and 16 Kbps via Intel IPP - 8Khz
 * G.729 annex B, D and E via Intel IPP - 8Khz
 * L16 audio - uncompressed 16bit mono audio in network byte order. All recommended sampling rates up to 48Khz.
 * GSM AMR (4.75, 5.15, 5.9, 6.7, 7.4, 7.95, 10.2, 12.2 Kbps - sending 4.75/10.2 Kbps, receiving any rate), octet aligned and bandwidth efficient mode, via Intel IPP - 8Khz
 * improved old inbound DTMF detector, and new Span DSP DTMF detector (enabled by default in Windows). Span DSP DTMF detector only available when sipXtapi is compiled with only narrow band suport. DTMF detection is mostly effective at 8Khz.
 * upgrade to Intel IPP 6.0 (compatibility with Intel IPP 5.3 maintained)
 * upgrade to speex 1.2rc1 library
 * usage of synchronous Portaudio API instead of asynchronous. Reduction of latency by ~160ms by this change.
 * possibility to adjust audio driver latency
 * linear complexity bridge
 * introduction of Span DSP 0.0.6pre3

Additionally, possibly these features will be implemented in milestone 1:
 * G.729.1 codecs via Intel IPP 6.0
 * AMR wideband via Intel IPP 6.0
 * correct handling of VAD, generation of noise frames internally when DTX occurs

==== sipXportLib ====
 * minor improvements in sipXportLib - OsSharedServerTask, OsRWMutex inherits from OsRWSyncBase and is write recursive. OsQueuedNotification superseeding OsQueuedEvent.
 * usage of OsTimerNotification for sending timer event messages. Custom notification subclass for each timer, avoiding any memory leaks.

=== Will not be addressed ===
 * TLS code, custom transport, SRTP, RTP over TCP, S/MIME
